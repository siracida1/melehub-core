/**
 * Phase 3 / S2 — what the Xtream per-category fallback is allowed to prune. Before this the fallback
 * never pruned at all, so titles removed by the provider stayed forever on any panel that can't serve
 * the bulk list; the risk in fixing it is deleting rows the pass never actually saw.
 *
 * The prune is scoped to the categories fetched *completely*, never the whole source — an item with
 * no category can't be returned by a per-category request, so a source-wide prune here would delete
 * every uncategorized row.
