/**
 * The portal's own guide, crawled into the shared EPG tables (report: "with my Stalker portal I
 * cannot see EPG or catch-up — STBEmu and TiviMate show both on the same portal and MAC").
 *
 * They can because they ask the portal for its guide. We only ever asked for the two programmes a
 * channel is showing around now (`get_short_epg`), which is enough for the preview pane and nothing
 * else: the Guide screen stayed empty, and **catch-up stayed unusable**, because picking a programme
 * to replay means picking it out of a guide that was never there.
 *
 * ## Why it is shaped like this
 *
 * Measured against a real 12 000-channel portal: `get_epg_info&period=7` answers in about a second
 * with 9 MB — 2 148 channels and 15 219 programmes. The endpoint is neither slow nor fragile. The
 * first version of this class still failed on it every time, with `unexpected end of stream`, because
 * it parsed the reply as it arrived and wrote each batch to the database with the HTTP response still
 * open. A keep-alive socket left idle while SQLite works gets closed by the far end.
 *
 * So: [download] the whole reply first and close the connection, then parse the file. Between those
 * two the portal is no longer involved, and a slow database cannot break a download. Everything else
 * here is about not giving up too early:
 *
 * 1. a broken or stale connection is **retried**, because that is precisely the failure above;
 * 2. a period the portal cannot serve steps **down** — 7 days, then 3, then 1;
 * 3. a portal with no working bulk endpoint at all falls back to **per-channel** `get_short_epg`,
 *    which every portal supports because it is what the Live preview already uses.
