 * Xtream panel publishes the number and is authoritative; measuring it would spend a minute and two
 * connections learning what it already told us. Stalker portals and M3U playlists almost never
 * publish it — one measured portal returns 162 profile fields without a connection limit among them
 * — and for those the only way to know is to open streams and watch.
 *
 * **It runs at most once per playlist**, when the playlist is added, plus whenever the user asks for
 * a re-test. [SourceEntity.maxConnectionsProbedAt] is what enforces that: a measurement that
 * concluded nothing is still recorded as having happened, so a playlist the probe cannot answer for
 * is not re-measured on every sync for the rest of its life.
