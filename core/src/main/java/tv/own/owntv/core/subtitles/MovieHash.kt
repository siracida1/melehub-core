/**
 * The OpenSubtitles "moviehash" (plan §3.3): file size + the first and last 64 KiB summed as
 * little-endian unsigned 64-bit words. Only computable when the COMPLETE media file is local —
 * OwnTV uses it solely for downloaded movies/episodes, as an optional search-quality enhancer.
 * Reads 128 KiB total, so it's fast; callers still guard it with a timeout and never let a
 * failure block the metadata search.
 *
 * It reads through a **stream** rather than a `RandomAccessFile` so that a download saved into a
 * folder the user picked — a SAF document, which has no path to open randomly — is fingerprinted
 * exactly like one saved to the app's own folder. Skipping to the last chunk is a seek rather than a
 * read in both cases, because both are a `FileInputStream` underneath.
