/**
 * Channels the user has pinned to one engine with the HUD "compatibility mode" toggle, because the other
 * can't play them cleanly — UHD-HEVC macroblocking on some VPUs, a stream only mpv decodes, or a panel
 * whose HLS only ExoPlayer opens. Self-learning: the user flips it once and the channel opens on that
 * engine forever after, whatever the global "Live TV player" setting says.
 *
 * Both directions are stored, because the global setting has both directions. While Live TV was always
 * ExoPlayer-first, "pinned" could only ever mean mpv and one list was enough; once a user can set mpv as
 * the starting engine — or as the *only* engine — the exception they need to record is just as often
 * "this one channel on ExoPlayer".
 *
 * Since v44 the pins live in `playback_quirks` (one row, one pin, shared by every profile, deleted with
 * its playlist). The DataStore file that held them before is copied in once ([CopyOnce]) and then left
 * on disk untouched for one release.
 *
 * Keyed by [enginePinKey] — sourceId + media type + provider remoteId — which is stable across
 * playlist re-syncs for all three source types. Channel rows are REPLACE-upserted on every sync, so a
 * column on the channel (or its Room id) would be wiped on refresh; the provider id is not. Pins made
 * by older builds are keyed by stream URL and still read (see [migrateKey] — P6).
