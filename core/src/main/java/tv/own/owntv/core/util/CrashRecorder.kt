/**
 * Keeps the last crash on disk so it survives the process dying.
 *
 * The 4.2.3 Live TV crash took days to find because the only way to see the stack trace was
 * `adb logcat`, and the people hitting it were watching television, not holding a laptop. A crash
 * that leaves no trace behind is a crash that has to be guessed at.
 *
 * This writes the trace to the app's own files directory the moment the process goes down, and
 * [PlaybackErrorLog.export] picks it up on the next launch — so the whole handover is
 * *Settings → Playback errors → Export*, and a file in Downloads the owner can be sent.
 *
 * The trace from a release build is obfuscated: retrace it with the `mapping.txt` of the matching
 * release. Line numbers are kept (`-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable`), so a retraced
 * trace names the exact line.
