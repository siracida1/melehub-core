/**
 * The two byte-count decisions a transfer has to get right, pulled out of [DownloadEngine] so they
 * are unit-testable without a network or a database.
 *
 * The rule both of them encode: **the file on disk is the truth.** The in-memory progress counter
 * lags a write, and a killed process loses it entirely, so neither the resume offset nor the paused
 * byte count may ever be taken from it (audit item DL2).
 *
 * They speak [MediaTarget] rather than `File` because a download folder the user picked on a phone
 * is a Storage Access Framework document, not a path — but the rule above is unchanged, and for an
 * ordinary file every answer here is byte-identical to what it was before.
