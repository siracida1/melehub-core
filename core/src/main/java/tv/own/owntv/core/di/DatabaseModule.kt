/**
 * Provides the Room database (WAL journal mode for fast concurrent reads during large imports) and
 * each DAO. Foreign-key enforcement is on by default in Room.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO destructive-migration fallback: [OwnTVDatabase.ALL_MIGRATIONS] covers every
 * shipped version, and a wipe-on-mismatch "safety net" would silently delete a user's profiles,
 * sources, favorites, history and resume positions on the first schema surprise. A missing or
 * failing migration must surface as an error we can fix, not as an empty app.
