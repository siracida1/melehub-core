/**
 * Size (as a percentage of screen width) and screen corner/edge for the docked mini-player. Both are
 * user-configurable in Settings → Playback and adjustable on the fly from the mini-player's controls.
 * The window is laid out as `fillMaxWidth(pct/100f).aspectRatio(16f/9f)` aligned to [MiniPlayerPosition],
 * so it scales consistently across TV sizes and the UI zoom (unlike the old fixed 340×191 dp box).
 *
 * The alignment each position resolves to, and each position's display label, are rendering concerns
 * and live with the mini-player in the app module.
