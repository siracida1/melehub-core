/**
 * Where a downloaded film or a live recording is actually written, in the two shapes Android has.
 *
 * [Path] is an ordinary file on a volume this app may write to: its own folder on internal storage
 * or on an SD card, which needs no permission at all, or anywhere on a **television**, which holds
 * `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and can therefore browse real directories. [Document] is a Storage
 * Access Framework document inside a tree the user picked from the system folder picker, which is
 * the only way a **phone bound for Google Play** can write to a folder of the user's own choosing:
 * Play restricts all-files access to file managers, backup tools and antivirus apps, and a media
 * player asking for it is refused at review.
 *
 * **This cost no database migration, and that is by design.** `filePath` on both `DownloadEntity`
 * and `RecordingEntity` is a `String`, and so is the `downloadRoot` preference; a document is simply
 * a `content://` URI in the same column. [of] is the one place that decides which is which, so no
 * caller anywhere has to ask. Every row written before this existed is a path and keeps working
 * untouched.
 *
 * Callers do not construct these directly — they ask [of] for a stored string, or [MediaRoot.child]
 * for a new one.
