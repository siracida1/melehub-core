 * the shape a drift takes: rename one and a user's library quietly splits in two. **Core owns the
 * names now**, both apps ask for them, and recordings get `TV/` alongside them rather than a fourth
 * private convention.
 *
 * The names are deliberately **not** translated. They are folder names on the user's disk, shared
 * between two apps and read by file managers and media players that know nothing about locales; a
 * library that renamed itself when the phone's language changed would be a library in two halves.
