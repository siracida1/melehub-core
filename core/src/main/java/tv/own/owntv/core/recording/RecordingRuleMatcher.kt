     * The form two programme titles are compared in.
     *
     * A guide is not consistent with itself: the same programme is `The News`, `The News (HD)`,
     * `THE NEWS`, `The News - Episode 4` and `The News [S2 E4]` across a week of XMLTV from one
     * provider. Folding is what makes "every showing" mean what the user meant rather than what the
     * provider happened to type.
     *
     * What is removed, and why each one:
     *
     * - **Case and surrounding space** — the cheapest and most common difference.
     * - **A trailing bracketed tag** — `(HD)`, `[S2 E4]`, `(Repeat)`, `(2024)`. These describe *this
     *   showing*, which is the opposite of what a title-match should key on.
     * - **A trailing episode suffix** after a dash or colon — `The News - Episode 4`. Keeping it
     *   would make every episode its own rule, which is precisely not "every showing".
     * - **Runs of whitespace and punctuation** — `The  News`, `The News.`, `The News:`.
     *
     * Deliberately **not** fuzzy. No edit distance, no substring matching: a rule that quietly starts
     * recording *Newsnight* because the user asked for *The News* is worse than one that misses a
     * showing, because the user finds out when the disk is full.

     *   what stops every guide refresh from re-scheduling the same week.
     * - **Anything whose title does not fold to the rule's key.** A guide row on the right channel
     *   at the right time is still the wrong programme if it is not the one asked for.
     *
     * A showing the user **cancelled by hand** stays excluded, because a cancelled row is still in
     * `existing`. That is deliberate: telling the app "not this one" and having it come back on the
     * next guide refresh would make the rule impossible to live with.
