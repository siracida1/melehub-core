/**
 * Finds a handful of playable URLs for a playlist that has **not been synced yet**.
 *
 * That constraint is the whole design. The measurement runs before the first sync writes a single
 * row, so that no channel exists for the user to be watching when the probe cuts a connection — and
 * so nothing has to be undone if the playlist turns out to be unusable. There is therefore no
 * database to read from, and each provider type has to be asked directly.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted, and the lists fetched are deliberately tiny: one page from a portal,
 * an aborted read of an M3U, an incrementally-parsed prefix of an Xtream response.
