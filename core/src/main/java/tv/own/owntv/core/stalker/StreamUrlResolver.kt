 * one-shot token re-handshake on expiry. Keep the stored `cmd` as the item's identity everywhere;
 * only the value handed to the player engine comes from here.
 *
 * **C-3 (§5.4.1) — live URL expiry:** a Stalker resolved URL dies after ~2-4h, so the playback
 * engines' auto-reconnect must NOT replay the dead URL for Stalker. Instead they call back into a
 * [ReconnectUrlProvider] (installed by `LiveViewModel` only for a Stalker source) to mint a fresh
 * URL before retrying. M3U/Xtream have no provider → the engines replay their stored URL as before.
