package tv.own.owntv.core.subtitles

/**
 * Builds the engine label for an attached external subtitle (§6.5/§8.4).
 *
 * The label is not decoration: every lookup that matters keys off it — which file a timing offset
 * shifts, which track is re-selected after a re-prepare, whether mpv's re-list treats a subtitle as
 * already attached. Two subtitles sharing a label are therefore indistinguishable to the player,
 * which is exactly how three same-language downloads used to collapse onto the first one.
 *
 * So a label must satisfy two things at once:
 *
 *  1. **Unique among ALL text tracks**, the file's own embedded ones included. The `OS_`/`LOCAL_`
 *     prefix puts our labels in a namespace a muxed track is very unlikely to occupy, but "unlikely"
 *     is not "cannot" — a media file is free to contain a track literally named `OS_Korean`. So the
 *     prefix is for the user's eyes and [build] still checks against the labels already present,
 *     numbering a collision away.
 *  2. **Informative**, because someone downloading a second subtitle in a language they already have
 *     is doing it precisely to get a different release — the first was out of sync or mistimed. The
 *     release name is the only thing that tells those apart.
 *
 * Deliberately locale-free (see the label rule on `rawTrackLabel`): the prefix is a fixed token, the
 * language and release names come from the provider, and the collision suffix is a bare number. A
 * label therefore never carries a translated word into engine state, where a locale switch could
 * strand it.
