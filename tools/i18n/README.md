# OwnTV translation and language contributor guide

`tools/i18n/locales.json` is OwnTV's authoritative language catalogue. It deliberately separates
three identifiers that look similar but serve different owners:

- `languageTag`: runtime BCP-47 (`he`, `id`, `sr`)
- `resourceQualifier` / `resourceDirectory`: Android (`iw` / `values-iw`, `in` / `values-in`,
  Cyrillic Serbian `sr` / `values-sr`)
- `weblateCode`: current Weblate language definition (`he`, `id`, `sr`)

Current Weblate language definitions are verified against
[WeblateOrg/language-data](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/language-data). In particular, default/Spain
Spanish is `es` (there is no `es_ES` definition), while Latin America is `es_419`.

**Canonical project overview:** <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/owntv/>

**New-language request form:** <https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BLanguage%5D%20Add%20>

The app, README, and this guide use these values from `community.json`; update that single source when either route changes.

## Requesting a new language

If the language is not available on Hosted Weblate, open a language request ticket before translating.
A maintainer will verify its BCP-47 tag, Android qualifier, Weblate language code, native name, script, and text direction; register it in `locales.json`; and prepare the language across OwnTV's six Weblate components.
The requester can then contribute normally through Hosted Weblate.

Registration does not package an empty language in the app.
Empty Android `values-*` directories remain forbidden; translated resources are imported and the language becomes eligible for explicit packaging only after it reaches the readiness threshold and passes validation and review.

## Supported, selectable, and catalogue-only

English (`values/`, canonical en-US wording) is the complete source. The small `values-en-rGB`
regional spelling override is packaged but hidden and is not a community translation target.
Existing reviewed community translations are packaged and selectable.

The 19 additions (`bg`, `hr`, `et`, `fa`, `fi`, `el`, `he`, `hu`, `id`, `lv`, `lt`, `ms`, `ro`,
`sr`, `sk`, `sl`, `th`, `uk`, `vi`) are **catalogue-only**. They intentionally have no Android
resource directories or seed files, compute as 0%, are discoverable for contributor-created Hosted
Weblate languages, and are neither packaged nor shown in the app picker. Do not seed or
machine-translate them.

## Readiness and promotion

The sole threshold owner is `translationReadinessThresholdPercent` in `community.json`; it is exactly
70%. The generator emits the same named Kotlin constant. A community locale below 70% must remain
unpackaged and unselectable. At 70% or above it becomes *eligible* for explicit maintainer promotion;
coverage does not silently change release packaging.

Promotion is intentionally manual, not generated:

1. Let Weblate create/sync all six Android resource files and run validation.
2. Run the coverage report and confirm at least 70%.
3. In the locale's single `locales.json` entry, change `tier` to `1`, `packaged` to `true`, and
   `pickerVisible` to `true` in one reviewed change.
4. Regenerate `SupportedLocales.kt` and README content; validate resources and build the app.
5. Review English fallback on missing keys and perform script/RTL/plural/focus smoke tests.

Gradle reads only `packaged` qualifiers from the catalogue. Generated Kotlin applies the threshold
again to picker rows as defense in depth. Coverage is calculated once by Python from Android resource
keys; it is not reimplemented in Gradle or Kotlin. The picker shows a badge only for visible community
locales below 100%; 100% badges, source English, system default, and hidden entries show no badge.

## Six resource components

Hosted Weblate covers the six source files independently so contributors can work across the whole UI:

- `strings.xml`
- `strings_content.xml`
- `strings_player.xml`
- `strings_settings.xml`
- `strings_setup.xml`
- `strings_features.xml`

Use the project/language overview, not one component or preselected language. The canonical endpoint,
README link, and app constant are generated from `tools/i18n/community.json`.

> **URL status:** the captain selected the Hosted Weblate project overview above as the canonical value.
> Changing the route requires editing that one value and regenerating the generated artifacts.

## Contributor and review workflow

1. Open the project overview and choose any available language.
2. Translate the relevant strings across all six components. Preserve placeholders and review
   translator comments/context.
3. Use Weblate quality checks and peer review; maintainers review the synchronized GitHub PR.
4. Missing translated keys safely fall back to English. Present malformed, empty, stale, or
   placeholder-breaking values override fallback and fail validation.

Captain's intended production access policy is non-default: anonymous visitors may directly add or
update translations. Weblate normally limits anonymous users to suggestions. Enabling direct
anonymous writes increases spam/moderation work and makes quality checks, Weblate review, GitHub PR
review, audit history, and rollback especially important; it is an explicit production-admin choice,
not a repository secret or a reason to block code implementation. Never commit Hosted Weblate admin
credentials, API tokens, webhook secrets, or operational secrets.

## Maintainer missing-key refresh

Use the existing durable seed pipeline when source English gains keys after a locale was seeded.
`prepare-translations --missing-only` compares each locale resource directory with the current source, records an exact hash of the existing translations, and prepares requests only for absent keys.
Successful responses and retries remain persisted under `runs/seed/<run-id>/`; promotion copies the existing locale into staging, appends only validated missing entries, validates the complete locale offline, and replaces it only if the recorded base hash still matches.

```sh
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi prepare-glossary --run-id <run-id> --locales <tags>
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi submit --run-id <run-id> --stage glossary
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi collect --run-id <run-id> --stage glossary
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi prepare-translations --run-id <run-id> --locales <tags> --missing-only --dry-run
# A later source refresh may add: --glossary-run-id <compatible-prior-run>
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi submit --run-id <run-id> --stage translation
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi collect --run-id <run-id> --stage translation
python3 tools/i18n/seed_translations.py --backend pi validate-and-promote --run-id <run-id> --locale <tag>
```

Repeat `submit` and `collect` when the collector queues scoped retries; already persisted successful responses are never resubmitted.
Do not use `--missing-only` for a locale without an existing resource directory, and do not bypass a base-hash refusal after translations change during a run.

## Validation

```sh
python3 tools/i18n/test_i18n_tools.py
python3 tools/i18n/validate_strings.py --report text
python3 tools/i18n/gen_supported_locales.py check
python3 tools/i18n/check_hardcoded_strings.py verify --bootstrap
python3 tools/i18n/check_number_locale.py
python3 tools/i18n/check_text_overflow.py
./gradlew :app:testStandardDebugUnitTest :app:processStandardDebugResources :app:lintStandardDebug
```

Never hand-edit generated `app/src/main/java/tv/own/owntv/core/i18n/SupportedLocales.kt`; run
`python3 tools/i18n/gen_supported_locales.py`. That command updates the generated locale catalogue and
README contribution link from the canonical source.

### Clearing a literal-inventory failure

`verify` only reports; no flag makes it write, `--bootstrap` included — that flag drops the
merge-base comparison and nothing else. Two failure kinds, two fixes:

```sh
# UNCLASSIFIED — a literal exists in code but in neither reviewed file.
python3 tools/i18n/check_hardcoded_strings.py classify-safe \
    --path app/src/main/java/tv/own/owntv/example.kt --text 'SELECT 1' --category sql

# STALE CLASSIFICATION — a classified literal was edited or deleted in code.
python3 tools/i18n/check_hardcoded_strings.py prune-safe
```

Both rewrite `safe_literals.txt` and regenerate `hardcoded_baseline.txt`. Classify a literal only when
no user can ever read it; categories and their reasons are listed at the top of `safe_literals.txt`.
Text a user *can* read stays unclassified so it lands in `hardcoded_baseline.txt` as declared debt —
that file may only shrink against a pull request's merge base. Never file real UI copy as technical to
make CI green; extract it to `strings.xml` instead, or leave it in the baseline for a later pass when
the fix is bigger than the string (persisted values, for example).
