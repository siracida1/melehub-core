/**
 * Lets mpv play a file it has no path to.
 *
 * A download or a recording saved into a folder the user picked through the system picker is a
 * Storage Access Framework document, and a document is a `content://` URI rather than a path.
 * ExoPlayer needs nothing for this — its `DefaultDataSource` already routes `content://` to
 * `ContentDataSource` — but **mpv opens by path**, and there is no path to give it.
 *
 * What mpv does understand is `fd://<n>`: an already-open file descriptor. So the URI is opened
 * here, and mpv is handed the number.
 *
 * **The descriptor has to outlive the call.** mpv does not duplicate it — it reads from the number
 * for as long as the file is playing — so closing it after `loadfile` returns would end playback
 * somewhere unpredictable a moment later. It is therefore held until the *next* stream replaces it
 * or the player is released, which is the only lifetime that is always long enough and still
 * bounded. At most one is open at a time.
