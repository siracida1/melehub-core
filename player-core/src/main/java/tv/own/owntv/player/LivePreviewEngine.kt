/**
 * ExoPlayer (Media3) that drives the muted **in-pane Live preview**. ExoPlayer starts HLS far faster than
 * mpv (which full-probes ~5 s before the first frame), so scrolling the channel list feels responsive.
 *
 * Full-screen Live TV also runs on this engine, unless the Live TV engine setting (global or per
 * playlist) or the fallback ladder puts the channel on mpv — then going fullscreen [stop]s this engine
 * and hands the channel to mpv. Preview and fullscreen use separate SurfaceViews on
 * separate screens, so the two decoders never share a surface. Historically one long-lived
 * instance, like [OwnTVPlayer]; it's [stop]ped (not released) whenever the preview isn't on screen.
 *
 * **Multiview needs several at once, and several is safe.** Every field of this class is
 * per-instance — the 25 `@Volatile`s included, which are marked for cross-thread visibility and not
 * for sharing — and the companion holds only constants and pure functions. What genuinely is
 * process-wide is shared on purpose and stays that way: [LiveDiagnosticsLog] (one log for the
 * device, and its `init` is idempotent), [AudioOutputPolicy]'s stereo latch (a fact about the
 * hardware, not about one stream) and the injected [PlayerDiagnostics]. [LiveEnginePool] is what
 * owns more than one of these, and what keeps exactly one of them audible.
 *
 * All calls must be on the main thread (ExoPlayer is single-threaded): the VM invokes [play]/[stop]/
 * [setMuted] from the UI thread and the Compose surface invokes [setSurface] from the holder callback.

     *
     * **1. The buffer is full and playback still won't start.** `DefaultLoadControl` has released it and
     * the load control is satisfied, so what is missing is a *renderer*: one of them has no sample it can
     * play at the current position. That is a broken stream, not a slow one — a mux whose audio and video
     * timestamps disagree, or an HLS rendition whose loading thread is blocked waiting for a timestamp
     * adjuster that never initialises (Media3 waits for that one forever by default). Traced on a 4K
     * channel that reported *twenty* seconds buffered and never produced a frame, whose `.ts` variant plays
     * — with audible A/V sync drift, the same defect from the other side. Nothing in ExoPlayer will rescue
     * it, so fail the load at once and let the ViewModel retry it in TS / hand it to mpv, instead of
     * holding a dead spinner until its open timeout.
     *
     * **2. The pre-roll can't be reached.** "Pre-buffer = 10s of video" is a threshold on the buffer, not a
     * wait, and a live stream can only be loaded as far ahead as its provider publishes. If the buffer has
     * stopped growing *short of* the threshold there is nothing left to wait for: drop the pre-roll for
     * that one stream and reopen it. A healthy stream keeps filling (at the live edge, roughly a second of
     * media per second) and is left alone. [PREROLL_OPEN_GRACE_MS] past the requested amount is the
     * backstop for one that dribbles rather than stalls outright.

 * single assignment (`tune = TuneState()`) and cannot be partially forgotten.
 *
 * **Membership is the whole design.** A field belongs here if a NEW channel must not see the previous
 * channel's value. Fields that legitimately survive a tune stay in the engine, where being absent from
 * this class documents that they are deliberate: the request identity (`tunedUserAgent` and friends,
 * re-assigned unconditionally on every tune), `lastTunedUrl` (whose whole job is to be compared with
 * the *next* url), the learned per-provider quirks (session-scoped by design), the StateFlows the UI
 * collects (they must keep their identity, so they are reset by value in [LivePreviewEngine.play]),
 * and the helper objects with their own reset (`throughputTracker`, `fpsSample`, `audioWatchdog`).
 *
 * Mutable `var`s rather than an immutable snapshot, deliberately: these are written from the playback
 * thread, the frame-release thread and the main thread as they always were, and copy-on-write would
 * turn every one of those writes into a lost-update race. The six that were `@Volatile` before keep
