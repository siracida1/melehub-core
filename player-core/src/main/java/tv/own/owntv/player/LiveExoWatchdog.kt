/**
 * Everything that decides a live channel on ExoPlayer is not working, and that mpv should be given a
 * turn.
 *
 * **This is the part that makes live TV survive real hardware**, and it is the reason a second engine
 * is worth having at all. The engine itself opens a stream and reports what happens; none of that
 * says when to stop believing it. These rungs were each added because a real channel on a real device
 * failed in a way nothing else caught:
 *
 * - **A picture that never arrives while the audio plays.** ExoPlayer never errors, so nothing times
 *   out — the user simply watches a black screen with sound.
 * - **Signed segment URLs the provider refuses.** Media3 can only re-issue the URL it already
 *   resolved, so retrying cannot recover it; mpv re-reads the playlist with a fresh token.
 * - **A stream that opens its playlist and then delivers nothing.** No frame, no error. The engine's
 *   own stall watchdog is armed only *after* the first successful play, so nothing fires and the
 *   spinner sits there for ever.
 * - **No decodable audio track.** An AC3/E-AC3/DTS stream on a box without that decoder plays
 *   silently and forever.
 * - **Played, then froze.** The engine's reconnect ladder is deliberately patient — well over two
 *   minutes of frozen picture before it admits defeat — and mpv, which often plays the very same
 *   channel, was never given a turn.
 *
 * It lived inside the television's `LiveViewModel` until now, which is why the phone had no second
 * engine to offer: not because anyone decided a phone should go without, but because the logic sat
 * where a phone could not reach it. Nothing here knows what a television is. It talks to a
 * [LivePreviewEngine] and calls back.
 *
 * **Every rung is gated on [stillOurs].** A watchdog outlives the tune that armed it — the user zaps,
 * backs out, or starts a film — and firing after that would stop a stream nobody complained about.
 * On the television's single-Activity player that stream can be a completely different programme.
