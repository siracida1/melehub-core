/**
 * Shared resolution classifier for both playback engines (ExoPlayer live preview and mpv), so a
 * channel never reports one quality on one engine and another on the other.
 *
 * Provider streams are frequently cinemascope or otherwise letterbox-cropped (3840×1600, 1920×800,
 * 1280×536): the picture loses *rows*, so height alone reads a real 4K feed as "1440p" and a 1080p
 * feed as "720p". Width survives a vertical crop, so we derive the 16:9-equivalent height from the
 * width and classify on whichever of the two implies the higher class.
 *
 * When width is unknown (some mpv property updates report height first) we fall back to height
 * alone rather than dropping the label entirely — a slightly conservative label beats no label.
 *
 * Anything below 480p is reported as its true height ("360p"), never rounded up to a standard.
