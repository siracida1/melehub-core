/**
 * App-wide single libmpv player. mpv (FFmpeg) decodes virtually any codec/container and exposes every
 * audio/subtitle track — the right engine for IPTV (ExoPlayer only surfaced device-decodable tracks).
 * Also gives caching, playback speed, etc. State is published as StateFlows for the Compose HUD.
 *
 * Some playback is handed to [ExoSubtitleEngine] (ExoPlayer): a VOD with an **image** subtitle
 * (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB), which mpv's direct path can't render; a VOD whose user chose ExoPlayer as its engine;
 * and a VOD mpv terminally failed, as a fallback. The handoff is transparent: ExoPlayer's state is
 * mirrored into these same flows.
 *
 * ## Threading (load-bearing — read before touching a libmpv call)
 *
 * libmpv calls are synchronous and can block for seconds while the core sits in a stalling network read,
 * so the rules are not stylistic:
 *
 * 1. **Commands and property reads/writes go through [mpvAsync] / `mpvExecutor`**, never the UI thread.
 *    Issuing them from main caused ANRs ("Input dispatching timed out"). A single worker thread also
 *    preserves the order the calls were made in, which the stop/loadfile classification depends on.
 * 2. **Surface attach/detach must be on the MAIN thread** — [attachSurface], [detachSurface] and
 *    [setSurfaceSize] are driven by `SurfaceHolder.Callback` (see [MpvVideoSurface]), and the surface is
 *    only valid for the duration of those callbacks. These few calls therefore touch `mpv` directly
 *    rather than going through the executor, and [assertMainThread] enforces it in debug builds.
 * 3. **Event callbacks ([event], [eventProperty]) arrive on mpv's own event thread**, not main and not
 *    the executor. They may read state, but anything that issues a libmpv call must hop via [mpvAsync].
 *
 * A future change that breaks rule 1 or 2 fails loudly in a debug build instead of racing intermittently
 * on one TV model.

    //     tunnel=0 — so the vSyncDiff counter goes silent; zero events meant "no instrument", not "no
    //     judder"). Then properly, with vo=gpu-next + opengl-swapinterval=1 + display-resample, which

    //     "Forcing queue refill, PTS(0.6) < VPTS(8.37)". Owner confirmed clearly worse, visible stutter.
    //     The GL path is a dead end on TV-class GPUs; both attempts removed.

     * while the hardware decoder was rendering a steady 50/s and ExoPlayer measured 50 with zero dropped

     * not: on that stream all three of `container-fps`, `demux-fps` and `estimated-vf-fps` read 60.0.
     * The provider's re-mux stamps the TS at a 60 rate while carrying 50 frames, so every piece of
     * metadata agrees and is wrong together.

/**
 * The two groups of per-playback state in [OwnTVPlayer], split exactly as the player's own reset was
 * already split - because that split is load-bearing, not incidental.
 *
 * [LoadState] is cleared on **every** load, including a silent retry or a software-fallback reload of
 * the same item. [ItemState] is cleared only when a **genuinely new** item starts (`resetRetries`),
 * because a retry of the same film must keep what it has already tried: an item whose retry budget and
 * "already tried software / the other extension / the fallback UA" flags reset on each attempt would
 * retry forever.
 *
 * They exist for the same reason as `TuneState` next door. The reset used to be two hand-written lists
 * of three dozen assignments, and a field added later but not added to the right list bleeds into the
 * next film - or, worse, into the next retry, where a spent rung looks unspent. One assignment each
 * cannot be partially done.
 *
 * **Deliberately NOT here:** the item's identity (title, url, contentKey and friends, assigned
 * unconditionally on every load, so they cannot go stale), the StateFlows the HUD collects (they must
 * keep their identity and are reset by value in `loadUrl`), the collections with their own clear
 * (`sessionExternalSubs`), and everything the user's settings own. Absence from these classes is a
 * statement that a field legitimately outlives a load.
 *
 * Mutable `var`s, like `TuneState`: these are written from mpv's event and log threads as well as the
 * main thread, exactly as before, and the fields that were `@Volatile` keep that individually.
