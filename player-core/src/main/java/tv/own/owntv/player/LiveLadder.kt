     *
     * Order follows where the tune *started*, so the engine the user (or a pin) asked for gets both of
     * its formats tried before the other engine is considered at all:
     *
     *  - started on ExoPlayer → `exo HLS → exo TS → mpv HLS → mpv TS`
     *  - started on mpv       → `mpv HLS → mpv TS → exo HLS → exo TS`
     *
     * An "only" [preference] keeps the first pair and drops the second: the chosen engine still gets both
     * of its formats — that step rescues most channels — but a stream it cannot play stays as a visible
     * failure instead of paying for a handover the user has said will not help. That is the whole
     * difference between the "first" and "only" modes here; see [EnginePreference].
     *
     * The HLS rungs are dropped entirely when this channel has no HLS/TS distinction — "Prefer HLS" off
     * for the playlist, a Stalker cmd, or a URL that is natively `.m3u8` — leaving the plain
     * `exo → mpv` (or `mpv → exo`) pair, which is what happened before any of this existed. A rung is
     * dropped for one engine alone when *that* engine has already learned this session that the
     * channel's `.m3u8` does not work for it.
     *
     * Why per-format rungs at all: a channel's `.m3u8` and its `.ts` are different muxes, and an engine
     * that chokes on one can play the other. Traced on a 4K channel whose HLS audio ExoPlayer can never
     * start (buffer full, `audio=false`), while mpv plays that very same `.m3u8` — so a ladder that
     * skipped `mpv HLS` after ExoPlayer's HLS failure was skipping the combination that worked.
     *
     * [hasHlsAlternative] is suspended deliberately: resolving it hits the source row, and it must run
     * at the same point in the sequence it always did — after this ladder has claimed [streamUrl].
