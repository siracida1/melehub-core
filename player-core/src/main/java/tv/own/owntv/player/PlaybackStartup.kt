/**
 * The start-of-process work the engines depend on, for every host. It used to live in the TV app's
 * `Application` and shell only, so on the phone the Detailed diagnostics switch did nothing, catch-up
 * software-decode lessons were forgotten on every run, and a restored latency or frame-rate choice
 * read as Balanced / Off.
 *
 * Call once from `Application.onCreate`, after Koin has started. Everything here is fire-and-forget on
 * [scope]: nothing on the launch path waits for it.
