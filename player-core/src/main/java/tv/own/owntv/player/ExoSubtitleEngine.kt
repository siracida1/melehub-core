/**
 * ExoPlayer (Media3) for VOD, in three roles: a VOD with an **image-based** subtitle (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB)
 * selected — the case mpv's direct path can't handle — the VOD engine fallback below, and the primary
 * engine when the user chose ExoPlayer for Movies/Series. ExoPlayer keeps the video on the same zero-copy
 * decoder→SurfaceView path *and* renders the bitmap subtitle on its own UI layer ([Cue]s → SubtitleView),
 * which mpv can't do without GL-compositing the whole 4K frame (the heavy path we removed).
 *
 * It is a **handoff**, not a sidecar: mpv is stopped first, so the provider only ever sees one connection
 * (IPTV panels routinely cap VOD at one). [OwnTVPlayer] owns this and mirrors its state into the same
 * StateFlows the HUD already observes, so the player UI is unchanged. All methods run on the main thread.
 *
 * It also serves as the **VOD engine fallback**: when mpv terminally fails to play a VOD (demuxer reject,
 * decoder stall, retry budget exhausted), [OwnTVPlayer] retries the same item here once ([start] with
 * `fallback = true`) before surfacing an error — some devices/streams play on ExoPlayer's MediaCodec
 * path where mpv's can't. In fallback mode no subtitle is auto-selected and errors are worded as
 * engine failures rather than subtitle failures.
